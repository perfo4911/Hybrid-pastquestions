#Hybrid-pastquestions
Simple hybrid code for my pass questions mobile app This appis includes the very basic of the web app .It merely reads data and provide to the users. The web app is at http://pastquestions-revision.rhcloud.com/

My Hybrid application is in loopback so you will need to do npm intsall after download to install dependencies and then On you command line cd to the folder and type node . to start server cd /path/to my /app node .

then go to the client folder with the loopback application and type cd /path/to/app/client ionic serve --lab

So the server is running on a different port from the ionic app
